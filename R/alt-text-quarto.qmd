Captions should generally be different than the alt text or screen reader users will hear the same text repeated twice.

## Images

### Caption only

Both of the options below create HTML that includes alternative (alt) text accessible to screen readers.

```{html}
<img src="https://mn.gov/portal/assets/primary-reversed-logo_tcm1077-265309.jpg" alt="Option * - Logo for the State of Minnesota.">

```

#### Two options

**Option 1**

![Option 1 - Logo for the State of Minnesota. ](https://mn.gov/portal/assets/primary-reversed-logo_tcm1077-265309.jpg)\

<br>

**Option 2**

![](https://mn.gov/portal/assets/primary-reversed-logo_tcm1077-265309.jpg){fig-alt="Option 2 - Logo for the State of Minnesota."}

### Caption & alt text

This image will include a caption below and alt text in the HTML.

Add `fig-alt` as a code chunk option like below:

```{{r}}
#| fig-alt: Scatterplot alt text...
```


```{r}
#| label: penguins-plot
#| warning: false
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Scatterplot of bill depth vs. bill length for individual penguins, colored by species.
#|   The relationship is positive for each of the three species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.
#| fig-cap: Holy donuts Batman! There is a positive association between the bill depth and length.

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

<br>

The resulting HTML is shown below and includes alternative (alt) text accessible to screen readers.

```{html}
<img src="alt-text_files/figure-html/penguins-plot-1.png" alt="Scatterplot of bill depth vs. bill length for individual penguins, colored by species. The relationship is positive for each of the three species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.">
```
